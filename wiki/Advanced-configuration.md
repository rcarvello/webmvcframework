## Introduction

You can configure WebMVC to use customized options such as setting the directories for storing your controllers, models,
views, and template, configure security options and much more.

In this section, we will clarify these details to permit you to understand any configuration option.
However, before starting, you need to know that, in most cases, you do not need to customize the execution environment
of your application, **the configuration we shown you on
the [previous page](https://github.com/rcarvello/webmvcframework/wiki/Setup) will be sufficient without the need of
doing something else**. In fact, all the other WebMVC configuration options can be used with their default values.
