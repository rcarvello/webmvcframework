## Overview

Role-based decomposition is a model for designing  **security** and **concurrency** in object-oriented software
development environments. In the software development process, the target software system consists of a large number of
components closely related with one another. This results in potential operation conflicts in security, as well as,
cooperative works among the project members. This problem can be much reduced by decomposing the target software system
into the relatively independent assemblies where each one incorporates a role-based decomposition model to separate
operation conflicts frequently occurring during collaboration. So, a basic WebMVC assembly is also designed for managing
role-based access control.   
We will' discuss the implementations for [Security](https://github.com/rcarvello/webmvcframework/wiki/Security)
and [Role-based](https://github.com/rcarvello/webmvcframework/wiki/RBAC) in the next sections.
